# FinanceNews

This project focuses on developing a topic modeling algorithm to analyze financial news data. The algorithm aims to provide insights to asset managers, ultimately influencing their investment strategies.  The data utilized includes sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral) and the text of financial news articles.  A key objective is extracting crucial economic indicators such as corporate financials, unemployment rates, GDP, trade agreements, and currency information.  The project will also examine the current state of Natural Language Processing (NLP) within the financial industry, demonstrating how professionals leverage NLP for insights.  The algorithm's analytics are intended to keep asset managers informed of financial news developments and market trends, enabling them to make timely and strategic investment decisions.
